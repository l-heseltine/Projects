    "The IHDI dataset below (Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index) was sourced from Kaggle.com. The index captures the Human Development Index (HDI) of the average person in society, which is less than the aggregate HDI where there is inequality in the distribution of health, education and income. Under perfect equality, the HDI and Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) are equal; the greater the difference between the two, the greater the inequality. \n",

    "The IHDI, estimated for 151 countries (which includes the world and other 150 specific countries), captures the losses in human development due to inequality in health, education and income. Losses in all three dimensions vary across countries, ranging from a few percent (Czech Republic, Slovenia) up to more than 40% (Comoros, Central African Republic). (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elmartini/inequalityadjusted-human-development-index)\n",

    "In order to supplement this dataset, I accessed the OECD iLibrary and was able to source additional, complementary data. The Better Life Index (https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/data/better-life-index/better-life-index-2015_data-00823-en?parentId=http%3A%2F%2Finstance.metastore.ingenta.com%2Fcontent%2Fcollection%2Fsocwel-data-en) allows for comparison of well-being across coutnries, based on 11 topics the OECD has identified as being essential, in the areas of material living conditions and quality of life. The format of the BLI dataframe was atypical. I cleaned and reformatted the dataframe in Excel to remove three additional stacked and nested headers, before importing it into Jupyter Notebook.\n",

    "I sought to use the cross-section between these two datasets to understand how rates of Human Development Index related to the OECD definition of a Better Life, and sought to undertake a projection using machine learning to understand how OECD countries' HDI might change over time. \n"
